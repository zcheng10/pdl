A sample video showing predicting the trajectory of a soccer ball is here:

In the video, the red boxes are the bounding boxes detected by YOLOv11, while the green boxes are the trajectory prediction of my model.

Here is the [paper](https://github.com/zcheng10/pdl/blob/main/theory/trajectory.pdf) explaining the theory and algorithm.
